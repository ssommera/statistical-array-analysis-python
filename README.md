# Statistical Array Analysis (Python Version)

This repository contains the **Python implementation** of the statistical array analysis project originally developed in Java.

🔗 **Original Java Version:** [statistical-array-analysis (Java)](https://github.com/ssommera/statistical-array-analysis-java)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to perform statistical computations and summaries on array data. This version is written in Python using only standard libraries, making it lightweight and easily portable.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This Python module replicates the core analysis of the Java version while leveraging Python's scientific computing stack for ease of experimentation and rapid prototyping. The focus is on clarity, modularity, and future extensibility.

This program generates a fixed-size array of random integers and computes:

- Extremal values (largest, smallest) with their positions  
- Secondary extremes (2nd largest/smallest)  
- Higher-order extremes (e.g. 5th largest/smallest) via sorting  
- The true median of the dataset  

All outputs are displayed alongside positional metadata, modeling the kind of summary statistics often used in feature engineering and data quality checks.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Mean, median, mode, min/max, variance, standard deviation  
  - Percentiles and quantiles  

- **Outlier Detection**  
  - IQR method and z-score based filters

- **Array Transformations**  
  - Normalization and standardization

---

## 🧪 Research Relevance & AI Applications

- **Data Preprocessing Pipelines**  
  Simplifies integration into AI workflows that require fast feature inspection and selection.

- **EDA Templates**  
  Offers a reusable scaffold for small-scale data investigations.

- **Statistical Scripting**  
  Demonstrates clean Python scripting for AI-related numeric computation tasks.

- **Parallel Implementation**  
  Complements the Java version as a benchmark comparison for performance or pedagogy.

## 🧠 Code Insights: AI & Data Science Principles

- **Pythonic Design**  
    Emphasizes clean syntax, list comprehensions, and modular functions.

- **Modularity**  
  Functions are organized for clarity, testing, and reuse.

- **Visualization Ready**  
  Integrates with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for optional visual output.

## 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.8+  

Run the module directly:
```bash
python statistical-array-analysis-python.py
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the module directly or import functions for use in notebooks or larger projects:
```python
from analysis import summarize_array
summarize_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

## 🔧 Potential Enhancements for AI Research

- Add CLI or web interface using Flask/FastAPI  
- Support for streaming statistics with `datastream` packages  
- Optional GPU acceleration via CuPy  
- Integration with sklearn pipelines for feature selection
